## Objects Interface

### Add: `objects/<uuid>/add`

The add command creates a new peripheral. It has to be called before the execute command can be sent to a created peripheral. Each add command has to have the following JSON parameters in addition to peripheral specific parameters.

| parameter | content                       |
| --------- | ----------------------------- |
| name      | unique name of the peripheral |
| type      | type of the peripheral        |

#### Dummy Peripheral

No extra parameters required

#### I2C Adapter Peripheral

| parameter | content          |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| scl       | clock signal pin |
| sda       | data signal pin  |

#### BH1750 Peripheral

| parameter   | content                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| i2c_adapter | name of the I2C adapter peripheral |
| address     | address of the BH1750 sensor      |

Note: The I2C adapter has to have been added

### Delete: `objects/<uuid>/delete`

### Execute: `objects/<uuid>/execute`

## Tasks

### Start: `tasks/<uuid>/start`

The start command starts a new task. Each start command has to have the following JSON parameters in addition to peripheral specific parameters.

| parameter  | content                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| type       | type of the peripheral        |
| peripheral | unique name of the peripheral |

On successful creation of the task, the following JSON is returned. In order to stop a long running task, its ID has to be stored on creation and then sent when it is to be stopped. The _type_ corresponds to the task's type while the _peripheral_ equals the name of the peripheral being used by the task. This may also be null.

| parameter | content                          |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| id        | unique ID of the task            |
| type      | type of the task                 |
| peripheral | name of the peripheral being used |

### Stop: `tasks/<uuid>/stop`

In order to stop a task, send its ID to the stop topic.

| parameter | content               |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| id        | unique ID of the task |

## Actions

### L293D Motors

The L293D motor drivers are used to power motors with up to 21 W (36V / 600mA). They require two pins to define the turning direction and one to enable and set the speed.
